###Wireframing

1.What is the purpose of wire-framing?

    To give a visual representation of design ideas before dedicating resources to them.

2.What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

    Low-fidelity: A sketch of a broad range of high level design ideas like navigation flow.
    Mid-fidelity: More focus on differentiating the individual components of the page.
    High-fidelity: Final look, sizing and layout of the page and it components.

    These are all useful ways to think about the construction of a page in steps and visually without the technical parts restricting you.

3.Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

    I believe that wireframes are very worth it for some. I don't think everyone would find it useful. When working as part of a team these wire-frame outlines would be essential for making sure everyone is on the same page.
