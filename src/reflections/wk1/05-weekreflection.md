##Week 1 Reflection

I had a lot of fun this week. It was challenging coming into something new, but I am proud of how much I have learned so far. Bootstrap was challenging at first but became easier the more I worked with it. The partner project really helped me understand better. The first week was tough adapting but I feel confident for the challenges going forward.
