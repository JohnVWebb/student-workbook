###The Mistakes I Made As a Beginner Programmer

1.What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

    you formulate a plan of approach, not necessarily a full schematic. it helps get ideas down onto something you can read and begin to iterate on those ideas. hopefully preventing getting stuck.

2.How do you find answers when you are stuck?

    I utilize the official docs of whatever tech I am using first and then move on to third party sites on google as well as my peers. If im really stuck I reach out to an instructor or someone much more knowledgable than I.

3.From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

    Research, ask questions, and plan ahead but not too far.
