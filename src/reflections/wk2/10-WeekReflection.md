##Week Reflection

    This week was tough but it was fun learning something new. I was struggling in the first half of the week but something started to click on thursday a friday. Now I am feeling good going into next week and ready for further challenges. This week flew by and I cant believe how much Ive learned and am already capable of making a web game. cool stuff.
