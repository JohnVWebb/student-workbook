###Encapsulation in JavaScript

1.What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

  To bundle data and methods that act on the data. Restricting access of the data outside of it.

2.What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?



3.How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

class name {
  this.#property = "";
}
instead of 

class name {
  this.property = "";
}
