##Weekly Reflection

This week has been really tough. Understanding the flow of the MVCS work flow has been a challenge as well as understanding where to put certain features. Small things like syntax of the new content this week are also giving me issues. I am really hoping I can figure out all this content. I may need to request a tutoring session.
